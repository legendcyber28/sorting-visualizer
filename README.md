# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This web application allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action, helping you understand how different algorithms sort an array of numbers. You can input any set of numbers, choose a sorting algorithm, and watch the sorting process step by step.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Observe how different sorting algorithms manipulate an array visually.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Includes popular sorting algorithms like:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the visualization from 1 to 10 seconds per step.
- **Pause Functionality**: Pause the visualization to take a closer look at the sorting process.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Get insights into why elements are being swapped or compared during the sorting process.
- **Input Handling**: Accepts 0 as a valid input in the array.

## Getting Started
